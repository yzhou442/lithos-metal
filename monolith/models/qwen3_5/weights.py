"""Checkpoint conventions of the HF ``qwen3_5`` checkpoints: text tensors live under ``model.language_model.``,
``lm_head.weight`` is present only when untied; ``model.visual.*`` (the vision tower) and ``mtp.*`` (the MTP head,
unused: speculation targets a DSpark drafter, design D10) are ignored. Everything else — stacking, permutations,
transforms — is declared by the layers' ``weight_map`` and handled by ``monolith.nn.pack_plan``.

An MLX conversion (``mlx_lm.convert``, affine 4-bit or BF16) is read through two adapters: the name map
(``language_model.model.*`` → ``model.language_model.*``) and the value map — mlx_lm's Qwen3.5 port multiplies by
its RMSNorm weights as stored, so the conversion folds the ``1 +`` of the zero-centered norms into the tensor
(input/post-attention layernorms, the final norm, q/k norms: stored ``1 + w``); the GDN gated norm, the conv taps,
``A_log`` and ``dt_bias`` are stored as HF stores them [M: the 0.8B under mlx 0.32]. Reading ``w`` back keeps the
package's ``one_plus`` transform and the oracle on the HF convention.
